# Swap Mod

The Block Swaping Block

Adds a block called "Swapper" that will swap one block to another when given at redstone pulse. The block swapped away will then be stored inside the swapper.

This makes it possible to do things like small animations, where you have a stone block change to a dirt block and back again. Or you could create a door by swapping between a block and no block (air). Or make i fancy with swapping parts of your redsone circuit.

You select the target block by sneak right click on a block, before you place down the swapper. If you do not set the target before placing the swapper, the target will be the block above the swapper.
