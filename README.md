# Swap Mod

Minecraft mod that swaps blocks.

Adds a block called "Swapper" that will swap two blocks when given at redstone pulse.

This makes it possible to do things like small animations, where you have a stone block change to a dirt block and back again. Or you could create a doorway by swapping between a block and no block (air). You could also make it fancy by swapping parts of your redsone circuit.

The Swapper can be places on difference directions (like the piston), and will swap the block in front of the swapper with the block behind the swapper.

## Future features

- Remote targets : A way to use other swap targets then front and behind.
- Internal storage : One target could be stored inside the swapper
